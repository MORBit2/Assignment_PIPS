This is a glorious package which includes a fantastic function, really, you'll love it! The make_art function is awesome- it accepts one arguement -- of the integer kind. It then uses the integer as a seed to create random beautiful, museum-worthy, computer-generated, future-breaking - Rt.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, eval =TRUE}

install.packages("aRtsy")
library(aRtsy)

make_art <- function(seed){
  set.seed(seed)
  canvas_ant(colors = colorPalette('house'))
}
```

## The following is an example of using the make_art function with seed 69:

```{r, eval =TRUE, echo= FALSE}

make_art(69)

```
